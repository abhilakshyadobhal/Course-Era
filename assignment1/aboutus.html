                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par excellence
                    in Hong Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it
                    enjoys patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best three-star
                    Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive on your plate the next time you visit
                    us.</p>
                <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by
                    our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>

                <h3>Peter Pan <small>Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
                <div class="d-none d-sm-block mt-4">
                    <p>Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who undertook the arduous
                        journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best future.
                        His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available
                        inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for
                        which <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this
                        restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>

                <div class="d-none d-sm-block mt-4">
                    <p>Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes from a long
                        established family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the
                        Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts it in
                        his own words, <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em></p>
                </div>

                    <p>Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO, personally ensures that every
                        dish that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if
                        their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto, <em>You click only if
                            you survive my lick.</em></p>

                        fusion experiences. He says, <em>Put together the cuisines from the two craziest cultures, and
